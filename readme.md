# Tommy's dotfiles

This is Tommy Mikalsen's dotfiles, with awesome stuff in it!

## How does it work?

`git clone` into `~/.dotfiles` and run `sh bootstrap.sh`. 

Mind you, if you have your own `.gitconfig`, you might want to back it up before you run the bootstrap script, as it overwrites stuff.

If you only want specific things, you could always just copy the files you want.
